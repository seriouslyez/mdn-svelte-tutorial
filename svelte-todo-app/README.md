I followed the tutorial found on 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Svelte_components

to build a functioning todo app. I followed the tutorial through part 4 which took me about 3 hours. I was able to implement update, filter, add, and delete functionality. I followed the tutorial pretty closely to so I could understand how everything fit together. I also went through and commented with the software concepts that were added throughout the tutorial using hashtags.
